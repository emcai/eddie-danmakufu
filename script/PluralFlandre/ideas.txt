Ideas:
Fear "Claustrophobia" - done
Terror "Recurring Nightmare" - bubbles appear first upwards then crash onto the player. Link for reference: http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=26435&page=2&pid=694632#p694632
Trap "No Place to Run" - 8 fairies appear that each fire rings of bullets. Boss fires sweeping side to side lasers.
Fear "No Escape from the Past" - done
Trap "Death by 1000 Cuts" - many thin lasers flood the screen and attempt to hit the player, while the boss shoots rings at player
Terror "Malicious Whirlwind" - Four "hurricanes" of bullets surround the corners of the map, then start moving around.
Fear "Triple Jeopardy" - three clones of the boss each throw a smaller version of earlier spell cards
Trap "Mirage of Safety" - bullets/lasers appear to be straight but suddenly start curving very weirdly
Paranoia "Impending Doom" (Survival) - rings of bullets surround the player's location non-stop
Terror "Non-Stop Nightmare" (Final) - final spellcard, tbd - throws all danmaku at the player
